# Image Grid Tool

A simple way to add grids to images.

I made it to make drawing from reference photos a bit easier - especially when you want to get proportions right without overthinking it.
It automatically suggests the number of rows and columns so each grid cell stays 1:1. You can customize line color, width, and add optional diagonals. Thereâ€™s also a simple cropping feature to adjust your image before adding the grid.
